# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
I developed a machine learning model to classify tweets as either related to real disasters or not.I worked with a dataset of 10,000 hand-labeled tweets.
In the context of emergency situations, Twitter has become a crucial communication tool:the widespread use of smartphones allows people to report emergencies in real-time, prompting various organizations such as disaster relief agencies and news outlets, to programmatically monitor Twitter for relevant information.

In this notebook you will find the data preprocessing,EDA and modeling using LSTMs, BERT, RoBERTa, ConvBERT, and BERTweet.

Each cell is commented, but if you have any questions please contact me.

Thank you for your time and have fun!

# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
I developed a machine learning model to classify tweets as either related to real disasters or not.I worked with a dataset of 10,000 hand-labeled tweets.
In the context of emergency situations, Twitter has become a crucial communication tool:the widespread use of smartphones allows people to report emergencies in real-time, prompting various organizations such as disaster relief agencies and news outlets, to programmatically monitor Twitter for relevant information.
Designed a sentiment analysis system to classify tweets into disaster-related or non-disaster-related categories.

Compared various models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and advanced transformers like BERT, RoBERTa, ConvBERT, and BERTweet. Achieved optimal performance with BERTweet, attaining an F1 score of 83.6%. Applied techniques such as tokenization, padding, and fine-tuning to enhance model accuracy and precision. Evaluated model performance using F1 scores and accuracy metrics.
